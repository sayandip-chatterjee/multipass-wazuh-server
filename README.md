## 📊 Accessing the Dashboard

1.  **Get your Multipass VM IP**

    multipass list
    ```

    Example output:

        Name       State    IPv4            Image
        wazuh-vm   Running  192.168.64.10   Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## 🛠️ Wazuh Dashboard Troubleshooting <a name="wazuh-dashboard-troubleshooting"></a>

1. **Check if Wazuh Dashboard service is running**
```bash
multipass exec wazuh-vm -- sudo systemctl status wazuh-dashboard
```
Expected: `active (running)`.

---

2. **Verify Port 443 is listening**
```bash
multipass exec wazuh-vm -- sudo ss -tlnp | grep 443
```
Expected output:
```
LISTEN 0 128 *:443
```

---

3. **Check Firewall (UFW)**
If UFW is enabled inside the VM, allow HTTPS:
```bash
multipass exec wazuh-vm -- sudo ufw status
multipass exec wazuh-vm -- sudo ufw allow 443
```

---

4. **Test From Host**
Run this from your **host** machine:
```bash
curl -k https://10.157.193.80
```
The `-k` option ignores SSL warnings.  
If you see HTML output, the dashboard is working.
